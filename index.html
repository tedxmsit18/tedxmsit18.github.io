                    For Vid, his travelling insticts came from his father but Savi had realised her love for travelling when at 18 she boarded her first flight. The beginings very humble and they never expected the turn of events would bring them so far. What a ride it has been since!

                    From being schoolmates to being friends to finally falling for one another it has always been as one for them. They both are hell-bent on 
                    questioning the convention, chasing happiness and phasing out the negativity and clutter that define modern life. From 
                    meandering down forgotten alleys, spending hours climbing building or spending days in finding the perfect baked croissant, their travelling is unique. About 7 years back they started off with*Bruised Passports* their blog to help people know how to effectively go about a travel plan. They have been on it since.

                <p>Pivoting on her heels and kicking that ball to flight is all Hans has lived for. 
                It’s not a frivolous task being a girl with high-soaring ambitions and too little backing. Born in Delhi, Tanvie Hans’ voyage from the streets of Delhi 
                to White Hart Lane hasn&#39;t been easy. Born with a knack for swinging the ball, Tanvie has represented Delhi at U-14, U-16 and U-19 tournaments.
                 What is unknown to most is the fact that she had to prove her prowess to all the haters out there by playing amongst boys.
                 Yes, you read that right! Owing to the fact that a girls&#39; football team was never given much boost, paved the way for her to play her sport for 
                Tottenham Hotspurs Ladies FC in London! With the right kind of push from her family, she was able to shut down haters and how! An alumna of Jesus and Mary College,
                 which boasts of the best women’s football team, she has given football her best shot and has truly succeeded at it. Being a British citizen by virtue of birth, 
                Hans has been opportune to prove herself a wunderkind in cricket and has been an inspiration for many out there. The rest is history!

                 The doctors deal with soldiers who fall ill mundanely but what struck them as worrisome was the fact that an improper medical assistance was being given
                 to these men at war; all owing to the unfavourable terrain. Medical doctors by profession, these noble men have stepped out of their niche and try their
                 hands on something they knew the Jawaans were in dire need of. “TeleMedicine, their innovation, is an amalgamation of information and telecommunication
                 technologies that provides readily available medical assistance at all times and places. The doctors have put their blood and sweat Ito make this mission

                <p id="aboutted">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organised
                    events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxMSIT, where x = independently 
                    organised TED event. At our TEDxMSIT event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and 
                    connection in a small group. The TED conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events,
                    including ours, are self-organised.
