      <h2>Savi and Vid</h2>
        <br>
     <p> Watch as Savi and Vid unfold about how to break the artificial borders and have the wanderlust sweep you away while unravelling the hidden gems of far of lands. Unfolding new horizons of the world as avid travelers and celebrated travel bloggers. They speak about how they left their jobs to chase their dream. Their talk not only tells us of their crazy journey traveling but also encourage gallivants to live up to their dreams. A leap of faith is what is required, it's one life and that's what should keep one alive enough. Acting on the dream is what would turn it into a reality. The talk instills in us how to stick to our blood insticts and celebrating one’s individuality. One should be looking back at life with satisfaction and sheer happiness and for that to happen one should go with what the heart calls for.

      <h2>Kamla Bhasin</h2>
        <br>
     <p> With the opening lines of “ Iam a Feminist and I do not hate men” she started with her Ted talk on the 19th of March,2017 with a great reception from the audience. She makes it clear that what women today are because of the efforts made by our foremothers and father, it didn't  latch off charity. Kamla Bhasin says her version of feminism is the bulb that fights the darkness of patriarchy, discrimination. Patriarchy and not against men, she makes clear. She's downright organic with her vesion. Sati, Child marriage , sex selective abortion are some of the things she's taken up. Further how patriarchy is widespread worldwide and how there's a need to strive for equality and not being same to men for no two people can be same. Her speech not only educated us about what transformational feminism is but also enlightened us about a very different sphere of what feminism really is , she sighted the various differentiations in our society and how they ought to be addressed. Her various experiences through the lanes of her life guided us about what a life she has seen through and the vision she wish to pass it on to the coming generation of Indians. <br>

        <br>
     <p> “I truly believe that the universe has ways to give you hints to tell you that you’re in the right direction.” From not being recognised as a football prodigy, getting expected to fit in the moulds preset from a woman; to leaving her homeland, playing her sport in a foreign land and being recognized for it; Tanvie Hans tells it all like it is! Tanvie Hans has been one of the best Indian female football players ever. She shares her story of playing for India and Britain and understanding the shortcomings of the scenario of sports in India. She talks of revolutionising football and sports as a whole, in her homeland. Hans has always dreamt of playing for her motherland and earlier a far-fetched dream, she is now working hard to turn this into a living reality! An initiative by her aims to sensitive the masses towards donating footballs or nay other sports equipment to those who may not be able to afford them. The goal is to inspire the multitude. She is relentless, unstoppable, fierce and a lioness! <br>

      <h2>Rashmin Pulekar</h2>
        <br>
     <p> Having been a chess aficionado all his life and one of the best in the country, at that; Pulekar takes to simplifying life in his austere words! The fulcrum of his wise words has been win over stress, trivial or gigantic, the chess way. Pulekar speaks of how one tends to bedlamize every milestone in one’s life as a pit-stop or a destination. A born story-teller, he masquerades his words in beautiful metaphors and blows the mind away. The simplicity of his diction is just mesmerising and hard to not fall in love with! He makes one and all explore the child within, reminding us that maybe these moutains are meant to be moved and not brought on our shoulders. Perhaps, after all, the destination is not definite at all, perhaps life is a series of pit-stops. Perhaps the fact that stress needs to be beat can’t be stressed more! <br>

      <h2>Sanjay Prakash</h2>
        <br>
     <p> Are cities living ? This is what Sanjay puts forth in front of us and started upon. Our cities are living, possessing life-like characteristics. There are capillaries that can be the highways, lifeblood that is the traffic and dead cells that are infrastructure. Like every other living being, urban cities too should have a DNA of their own. A DNA that would allow growth and adaption. Cities need to be planned in a functional way.The major question that arises today is how do we design? all the cities are different but they have functional similarities that branch them together as an unit. The biggest mistake architecturally in the last century was to make a system that would last long hence putting the system in a skeleton that would not be function and just stand still. Delhi’s Rajiv chowk buildings that saw its collapse few years back is a prominent example. He further denotes few innovative ways of designing cities, the trial and error method, participation and collaboration between specialists. He quotes, "We should look up to the future because that's when we plan to adapt and grow." He speaks about his recent project in Jodhpur that has quite well surmited from around 500 years ago to make it water sufficient in between areas of drought and deserts by following techniques of system dynamics building baolis, borewells and stepwells.<br>

      <h2>Dr. Hotta and Dr. Rohit</h2>
        <br>
     <p>“Necessity is the mother of invention but difficulties give way to innovation”
Dr. Hotta and Dr. Rohit are the BSF doctors who deal with Jawaans on a daily basis, thus, understanding the root of all their problems, related to medicine and healthcare. “As doctors, the typical hospital setup were all we were acclimatised to, at an early stage. It was when we joined the BSF, that the stones turned”. The doctors speak of the lack of proper medical aid reaching India’s Jawaans. They decided to put an end to thesis issues by combining information and communication technologies. “India is an I.T. giant”, they say. Eureka! They came up with the concept of “TeleMedicine” that renders any patient to get medical aid without having to show up at the doctor’s clinic. The three prerequisites for this were: a computer, an internet connection and an EMR (Electronic Medical Record) software developed by the doctor’s unending initiative! They have truly made all Indians proud with their august act!

  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: red;" >What is TEDx?</h2>  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organised events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxMSIT, where x = independently organised TED event. At our TEDxMSIT event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organised.</p>
